## Step one
// some of the inputs have more inherent values than others
// for academics - pdf and source texts
// for cooks - many articles, recipes and grocery list to track
// we have to consiously priorities our notetaking efforts, we can't capture it all and we don't want to. we just want to get 10% more out of the most important and useful information that is already passing through our life.

## Step two
### Quick capture what resonates
// When new source of information enters your life... you have a conversation with your "" or you got an important email. That little piece of information has a suggestion for you. And the default suggestion is that `This is important, Do This Now(Drop everything)` instead of imediately accepting the default frame of that incoming information you have a new option. You have a notes app. When you encounter that information open your phone or computer 
`Write it down don't respond imediately; just write it down on this 'Quick Capture' 
// If you are at your computer and you get an email - don't respond, just write it down.
// Don't read the article, just write it down.
// Don't watch that video, write it down.
// This step shows why it is important to not switch your notes app for 30 days. A lot of us needs to spend those 30 days just flexing our noticing muscles. What's interesting or exciting to you also can be called `Capture What Resonates` and is single most important skill in taking notes.

## Step three
### Reframe your inputs
// So now it's the end of one day of strenuous noticing, you're probably tired. This is a big list of quick captured information, it's overwhelming. Realistically the first time you do this you'll probably give in and start doing some of these tasks immediately. If you couldn't resist doing tasks right away that's okay! The ability to not immediately react to our inputs, not immediately do the urgent tasks that's a muscle too. Let's create SIX new notes to start to put each of your inputs into the six main categories that you're gonna need for your productivity. You can title these notes as Tasks, Read/ Watch Later, Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives.
These new notes represents your categories of intentions. :-
- [[Tasks]] - These are any actions to do's that you need to take in the future. We can organize and sort them later but for now just move anything that needs any immediate or future action to this note. Separating tasks from all of the rest of your notes is super important!
- [[Read or Watch Later]] - This is a special of tasks. Think of it as `Optional tasks`. A place to store things that might be interesting to consume later but you aren't going to watch or read now.
- [[Projects]] - This is anything big that you want to do. A new idea or ambitious thing that you're working on now or in the future that will contain a lot of subtasks. ==Projects a have goal and they have a deadline==. Things like planning and completing a specific piece of writing. Finishing a multi-week work project. Or sending out a family function card are all projects.
- [[Areas]] - This is anything that's important to spend time and energy on but that doesn't have a specific deadline. Your family finances are an area, your key life relationships are an area. Such as with your spouse or business partner. Your health is an area.
- [[Resources]] - This is going to be anything that you want to hang on to for future reference related to any of your interest for eg. languages, history or films.
- [[Archives]] - This is where you drop anything that isn't needed to move any of your projects or goals forward for example if you captured something it seems interesting but isn't currently important or it doesn't seems relevant to any of your current efforts just move it to the archives.

	Now you can see that at the end of this process you have a bunch of to-do's that you can work through all at once or I can sort them into sublists of to-do's that are for today, for tomorrow, for next month, for sunday. You can add to-do's list into the calendar app if you have one. But the key detail here, the key thing to notice is your actionable to-do's are separate from all the rest of your other notes. You also now have items that you can read later or watch later. When you have time. If you have some down time in your schedule or if I want to spend some time reading or watching in the evenings or on the weekends or on vacations. You no longer need to feel overwhelmed or behind on my reading, because it's always available to you if you need it when you want to read it. You now have a rough first draft of a project list. When starting the list it will be a bunch of random ideas and tasks and inputs. After a while you can clearly see multiple important things in your life with actions that will move them forward and you can spend your time intentionally working on these, instead of vaguely hoping to do them someday. You will have an areas list, if you ever need to find an idea related to any of these areas of your life you know where to check. And you will have a better sense of all things you need to keep track of and support in your life. What this means is `You are much less likely to over commit too many projects` as you know you will put your key areas at risk if you over commit elsewhere in life. You have a list of resources that you can check if you're ever interested in those topics again but at the same time you don't need to look at this list very often. You are probably going to look mostly at your projects since those are the most relevant to you each day and you'll just check your resource notes when you need them. And finally, you have your archives! You don't ever need to revisit these if you don't want to but they aren't cluttering up your other categories of notes and thoughts in the meantime!

## Step four
### Develop Daily Practice
// Now we have our quick capture and we're starting to gather inputs in our life and sort them into new categories based on what they actually mean to us and specific circumstances and objectives. 
How to make this practice:
1) Every day capture notes into your notes app whenever something resonates with you, save it to your quick capture note.
2) Start every day by simply reviewing your task list note what's important to do today third once or twice a week as often as makes for you review your quick capture and sort it into new notes (Tasks, Read/ Watch Later, Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) that way you can focus on your tasks and set aside time to consume new content, work on major projects or find important resources that matter to you based on category.
3) ==Once a week review your Projects and Areas notes==, 
	1) If a project was completed move it and all the information about it to the archives. For your active projects, the once you're working on right now, add new tasks to your task list, so you can move the project forward this week when you check your daily tasks.
	2) For your Areas, check out anything new and make sure you create tasks for anything important that you want to honor this week.
If you consistently follow this practice with your notes app any notes app it's guaranted that by the end of 30 days you'll have a radically transformed sense of peace, control and momentum in your day-to-day life.
